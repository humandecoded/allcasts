## allcasts ðŸ“» ðŸ—ƒ


A Python script for downloading all available episodes from a podcast RSS feed. Useful for making private archives of your favourite podcasts.
This is a stripped down version of the original.
This version relies on `response.get()` as opposed to `wget` thus allowing us to pass a user-agent along with our download request.
