## allcasts ðŸ“» ðŸ—ƒ


A Python script for downloading all available episodes from a podcast RSS feed. Useful for making private archives of your favourite podcasts.
This is a stripped down version of the original.
This version relies on `response.get()` as opposed to `wget` thus allowing us to pass a user-agent along with our download request. 

### Updates to Original Allcasts.py
* When downloading, Allcasts will check if that file already exists in the save directory and skip if necessary. This gives you the abillity to build it out a list of RSS feeds you would like to check periodically and end up with a well organized collection of files. 
* Now have the ability to designate saving sub-folders on a per url basis when using the `-i` option
